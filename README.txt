## Privacy Policy 🔒

AR Model Viewer for WooCommerce uses the Freemius SDK to collect telemetry data, but only with the user's explicit consent. This data collection helps us troubleshoot issues and improve our product.

- **No data is gathered by default.**
- Data collection only begins **after user consent via the admin notice**.
- Collected data ensures a great user experience.

Integrating the Freemius SDK **does not immediately start data collection without user confirmation**.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Use the Settings -> AR Model Viewer for WooCommerce screen to configure the plugin.
4. Start adding 3D models to your WooCommerce products using the custom metabox provided in the product edit screen.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which file types are required for the 3D models/scenes? =
GLTF (*.glb) files are required for the 3D preview in the browser and the AR scenes on Android devices. Apple devices, such as iPhone, iPad or Apple Vision Pro, on the other hand, require **USDZ** (*.usdz) files to display AR content. AR Model Viewer for WooCommerce also adds support for **Reality** (*.reality) files for Apple devices.

= Do I have to add models for Android and iOS? =
To ensure that all visitors to your website can see the AR scenes, each scene must have a dedicated model in both formats (.glb, .usdz) for Android and iOS/Apple devices. However, only a GLTF file is required for the 3D preview in the browser.

== Mini-Tutorial: Getting Started ==

1. **Install and Activate**: Download and install the AR Model Viewer for WooCommerce plugin from the WordPress plugin repository.
2. **Configure Settings**: After activation, navigate to the Settings -> AR Model Viewer for WooCommerce screen to configure the basic settings for the plugin.
3. **Add 3D Models**: Go to the WooCommerce product edit page and locate the "AR Model Viewer" metabox to upload your .glb (for Android) and .usdz (for iOS) 3D models.
4. **Preview in AR**: Once uploaded, your 3D models will automatically be available for customers to view in augmented reality (AR) on compatible devices.
