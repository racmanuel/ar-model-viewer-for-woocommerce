- Collected data ensures a great user experience.

Integrating the Freemius SDK **does not immediately start data collection without user confirmation**.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==  

= Which file types are required for the 3D models/scenes? =  
GLTF (*.glb) files are required for the 3D preview in the browser and the AR scenes on Android devices. Apple devices, such as iPhone, iPad, or Apple Vision Pro, require **USDZ** (*.usdz) files to display AR content. AR Model Viewer for WooCommerce also adds support for **Reality** (*.reality) files for Apple devices.  

= Do I have to add models for Android and iOS? =  
To ensure that all visitors to your website can see the AR scenes, each scene must have a dedicated model in both formats (.glb, .usdz) for Android and iOS/Apple devices. However, only a GLTF file is required for the 3D preview in the browser.  

= What is meshy.ai, and how does it integrate with the plugin? =

= How do I use meshy.ai to generate 3D models? =

= Are there additional costs for using meshy.ai? =  
Yes, meshy.ai operates on a credit-based system. However, you can start with a free plan that includes **200 credits per month**. If you exceed the free credits, you will need to purchase additional credits from **meshy.ai**.  

= Can I use the generated 3D models for both Android and iOS? =  
Yes! Once a model is generated using **meshy.ai**, you can convert it to GLTF (*.glb) for Android and USDZ (*.usdz) for iOS/Apple devices. The plugin also supports **Reality** (*.reality) files for Apple devices.

meshy.ai follows strict security protocols to protect your data. Generated models and API requests are processed securely, and no sensitive information is shared or stored without your consent.

Not at all! The integration is designed to be user-friendly. Simply describe your object or upload an image, and the AI takes care of the rest.  

= Can I use this plugin without meshy.ai? =  
Yes, the plugin fully supports manual upload of 3D models in GLTF, USDZ, and Reality formats. However, using meshy.ai adds powerful AI-driven features for generating 3D models from text or images.
